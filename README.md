# Duke's Country Kitchen (Resident Evil Village)
A Manual apworld for Archipelago for Resident Evil Village, but with a fishing-themed twist!

## How to Use
1. Grab the most recent apworld and example YAML from the [Releases](https://github.com/FuzzyGamesOn/DukesCountryKitchen/releases) page.
2. Download and install Archipelago if you don't have it already: https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases
3. Put the apworld in the `lib/worlds` folder in the Archipelago install (typically in ProgramData).
4. Put the YAML in the `Players` folder in the Archipelago install referenced above.
5. Run the Generate executable and upload the zip (in `output`) to the Archipelago website, and follow the instructions!

## Why Fish?
Why not?

## What's a Manual?
Manual is an apworld templating system for Archipelago. It allows creating randomizer scenarios for any game, which you complete via an interactive checklist of sorts. Find out more in our Discord: https://discord.gg/T5bcsVHByx
